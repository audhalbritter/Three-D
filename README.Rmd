# Summary

Multiple global change drivers including land-use and climate change, and pollution threaten alpine biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Experimental approaches can be used to disentangle the single and interactive effects of these drivers. Across three sites along an elevational gradient (469 - 1290 m a.s.l.) in south-western Norway, we exposed plant communities to warmer climate, nitrogen fertilization, and grazing, as well as simulated grazing by clipping, in a fully factorial design. After three years of treatment, we recorded data on vegetation, ecosystem functioning, and microclimate in 160 experimental and control plots. This database consists of records of the following datasets: aboveground standing biomass (3,417 records), aboveground plant productivity (2,071), reflectance (1,769), vascular plant community composition (8,954 records covering 95 taxa), belowground productivity and traits (796), soil characteristics (193), soil nutrient (1,132), ecosystem CO2 fluxes (2427), soil ecosystem CO2 respiration (64), and microclimate (30,751,264). The data can be combined with long-term climate and plant functional traits collected within the study region.

![*Table 1 Description and location of the datasets in the ThreeD global change experiment. This table shows the dataset number, response variable(s), number of observations, number of taxa, number of plots, treatments, and temporal range of the data. The abbreviations in the treatments are W = warming, N = nitrogen addition, G = grazing, and C = clipping. The raw data are available on OSF, the final published data are available on Zenodo, and the code for extracting and cleaning raw data is available on GitHub.*](Pics/Table_1.png)


## Data organization and structure

The raw data files are available on [OSF](https://osf.io/pk4bg/) and are stored in folders using the dataset number and response variable used in Table 1. Each filename also starts with a dataset number corresponding to Table 1. All raw data files are indicated with “raw” and have an associated readme file. The readme file or a tab in the dataset called readme explains each variable in the data files.

The final data files are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/uploads/17258667). The file names follow the same structure: nr_Three-D_clean_variable_year(s).csv, where nr refers to the dataset number in Table 1, the variable corresponds to the response variable in Table 1. The code to clean and manage the data files on OSF is available in the ThreeD GitHub repository35 with a versioned copy archived in Zenodo (REF).

All datasets are structured similarly, sharing some common variables including year, date, (orig/dest)siteID, -blockID, -plotID, turfID, and treatments and specific variables that are unique to each dataset (Fig. 2). The shared variables can be used to link different datasets, for example to combine them for specific analysis (bold letters in Fig. 2). For example the climate data can be joined by date, siteID, blockID, plotID, turfID and treatments to the biomass to test the relationship between soil temperature and biomass.


![*Figure 2 The boxes represent the dataset i to xv (corresponding to Table 1) with the names of each dataset shown in the coloured area. Note that the dataset names are shortened and abbreviated in this figure because of limited space (ag = aboveground, bg = belowground, veg = vegetation). The main variables of each dataset are shown below and for the full list of variables for each dataset see Tables 2–16. The variables in bold indicate keys that can be used to join the different datasets (Table 2). The line linking the variable species indicates one example for such a link. These keys can also be used to link to data from the Plant Functional Trait Course 6 (PFTC6) and the Vestland Climate Grid (VCG) in Vestland County in Norway and are explained in the box at the bottom. Three example datasets with their keys are shown. Abbreviations stand for: SOM = soil organic matter, veg. = vegetation, nee = net ecosystem exchange, gpp = gross primary production, and ER = ecosystem respiration.*](Pics/ThreeD_database2.png)

Datasets collected at plot level that include the warming treatment (transplant) contain plots that have been moved from the “origin” site to the “destination” site. The siteID, blockID and plotID therefore contain the prefix origin or dest (for destination) to indicate if the variable refers to the origin or destination. For control plots that have not been moved, the origin and destination is the same.

## Data sets and data dictionary

### Dataset (i) Elevation and coordinates

This dataset contains elevation, latitude, and longitude for each site and has three observations.

```{r site-dic}

tar_load(site_dic)
knitr::kable(site_dic)
```


### Dataset (ii) Slope, aspect, and soil depth

This dataset contains slope, aspect and soil depth and has 480 observations. The average slope was 8.9 ± 0.15 degrees at the boreal site, 11.0 ± 0.07 degrees at the sub-alpine site and 12.4 ± 0.13 degrees at the alpine site.
The aspect was 270 ± 1.23, 247 ± 0.89, and 246 ± 1.42 degrees at the boreal, sub-alpine and alpine sites, respectively.
The soil was deepest at the boreal site (15 ± 0.13), and was shallower at the sub-alpine site (13.0 ± 0.05) and alpine site (11.7 ± 0.09; Figure 3). 

![*Figure 3 Soil characteristics at the boreal, sub-alpine and alpine sites. Shown are soil depth, bulk density, pH, carbon and nitrogen content, and soil organic matter. The colours indicate the site. Note that the measurements were done at different layers (i.e. the top 5 cm, below the top 5 cm, or the total soil core). Bulk density was measured at both the top 5cm (lighter colour) and below the first 5 cm (darker colour). pH was measured in the top 5 cm and the other variables were all measured for the total soil core.*](Pics/soil_figure.png)

### Dataset (iii): Aboveground standing biomass

This dataset contains the aboveground standing biomass from the clipping treatments in 2020 to 2022 and from the control plots in 2022.
The biomass is separated by functional groups and this dataset has a total of 3417 observations, including 188 from control plots, 1175 from intermediate clipped and 2054 from intensive clipped plots.
In 2022, in total 1502 g biomass was removed in the control plots, and in total 1315 g biomass was removed in the intermediate and 1239 g in the intensive clipped plots per year.

In terms of aboveground standing biomass, forb biomass dominated in the alpine site, while graminoid biomass dominated in the sub-alpine site (Figure 4).
With warming in the alpine site, forb biomass decreases while graminoid biomass increases. Shrubs and Cyperaceae almost exclusively occur in the alpine site, and decrease with warming.
Bryophyte, legume and litter biomass is generally low. Legumes occur in the warmed alpine plots.

![*Figure 4 Proportional functional group composition. Proportion of biomass per plant functional group at peak growing season in 2022. Shown are the proportion of shrubs, graminoids (grasses and rushes), Cyperaceae (mostly Carex species), forbs, legumes, bryophytes, and litter, for the different nitrogen addition treatments in non-grazed (Control), medium and intensive grazed plots. The two top rows are the ambient and warmed plots in the alpine site, while the two lower rows are ambient and warmed plots at the subalpine site. The general pattern is that graminoids increase and forbs decrease with higher nitrogen addition treatment.*](Pics/biomass.png)

### Dataset (iv): Aboveground plant productivity

This dataset contains the aboveground plant productivity from grazed control plots and ungrazed caged plots at all three sites in 2019 (at functional group and species level) and 2022 (at functional group level) and has a total of 2,071 observations.

In 2019, annual productivity (summed biomass from caged plots) was consistently higher in the permanent plot compared to the temporary plots.
Productivity was similar at the boreal (permanent: 0.050 ± 0.005 g cm^-2^ y^-1^; temporary: 0.021 ± 0.002 g cm^-2^ y^-1^) and sub-alpine site (permanent: 0.036 ± 0.003 g cm^-2^ y^-1^; temporary: 0.025 ± 0.002 g cm^-2^ y^-1^), and lower at the alpine site (permanent: 0.018 ± 0.003 g cm^-2^ y^-1^; temporary: 0.014 ± 0.002 g cm^-2^ y^-1^).

In 2022, annual plant productivity (summed biomass from caged plots) was the same at the boreal site (0.102 ± 0.008 g cm^-2^ y^-1^) and the sub-alpine site (0.106 ± 0.011 g cm^-2^ y^-1^), but decreased at the alpine site (0.026 ± 0.002 g cm^-2^ y^-1^).
The consumed biomass (cage - control) was the same at the two lower sites (boreal: 0.017 ± 0.005 g cm^-2^ y^-1^; sub-alpine: 0.017 ± 0.015 g cm^-2^ y^-1^), and decreased at the alpine site (0.003 ± 0.002 g cm^-2^ y^-1^), but this was not statistically different.

### Dataset (v): Reflectance

The reflectance dataset contains a total of 1,769 observations.
There are 1,689 observations, representing several measurements from all plots in 2020, and 80 observations from one round of measurements at the alpine site in 2022.
The NDVI values are on average around 0.69 % ± 0.004 (range: 0.29–0.96 %).
NDVI was lower at the start (June: 0.52 % ± 0.007) and end of the growing season (September: 0.51 % ± 0.007) and was higher at peak growing season (0.76 % ± 0.003).

```{r ndvi-dic}

tar_load(ndvi_dic)
knitr::kable(ndvi_dic)
```


### Dataset (vi) Below ground productivity and root traits

The below ground productivity (i.e. fine root productivity) and root traits dataset contains a total of 796 observations.
The data from 2021 contains below ground productivity from one growing season (i.e. May/June - September; n = 160). The data from 2022 contains 636 observations of annual below ground productivity as well as root traits.

The growing season below ground productivity was 2 times higher in the sub-alpine (2.53 ± 0.271 mg cm^-3^ per growing season) than the alpine site (1.24 ± 0.309 mg cm^-3^ per growing season).
The annual below ground productivity was 2.3 times higher in the sub-alpine (2.16 ± 0.268 mg cm^-3^ y^-1^) than the alpine site (0.95 ± 0.228 mg cm^-3^ y^-1^).
The below ground productivity for one growing season was 17% higher at the sub-alpine site and 30% higher in the alpine site compared to annual growth.
This suggests that there is little growth outside the growing season and a considerable amount of root death. Note that the amount of dead roots were however not assessed.

Root dry matter content (RDMC) and root tissue density (RTD) were slightly higher in the sub-alpine compared to the alpine site (RDMC sub-alpine: 45.6 ± 3.69 mg g^-1^, alpine: 36.1 ± 6.51 mg g^-1^; RTD sub-alpine: 0.203 ± 0.013 g cm^-3^, alpine: 0.171 ± 0.009 g cm^-3^ ), while the pattern was opposite for specific root length (sub-alpine: 173 ± 22.7 m g^-1^, alpine: 251 ± 41.2 m g^-1^ ), however none of the root traits differed significantly between the two sites.

### Datasets (vii, viii): Vascular plant community composition

The vascular plant community composition dataset contains a total of 98 identified taxa and 8,954 observations of cover data at the plot level.
The dataset contains 13 observations (0.15 %) with unidentified species and 542 observations (6.1 %) identified to the genus level.

The species composition differed between the alpine and sub-alpine plant communities, with alpine communities on the right side of the principle component analysis (PCA; Figure 5).
The first PCA axis explained 38.8 % of the variation and is strongly related to warming in the alpine community, while the second PCA axis explained 7.9 % of the variation and was more related to warming in the sub-alpine community and nitrogen addition. Grazing and clipping did not show a clear pattern in the ordination.

Species richness varied between 4 and 37 species per plot and was on average higher at the alpine site (24.3 ± 0.29) compared to the sub-alpine site (9.7 ± 0.15).

### Dataset (ix): Vegetation structure

The vegetation structure dataset has 4’237 observations.
Sum of cover (i.e. the sum of vascular plant cover including the layering of vegetation which can exceed 100 %) was on average 102 ± 1.0 % per plot (range: 39–177 %), while vascular plant cover (without layering of the vegetation) was 81.5 ± 2.1 % (range: 5–100 %). Sum of cover was higher at the sub-alpine site, while vascular plant cover did not differ. The average litter cover was  31.0 ± 2.1 % per plot (range: 2.3–99.5 %), bryophyte cover was 34.1 ± 2.22 % (range: 0.1–96.0 %), and lichen cover 5.16 ± 0.739 % (range: 0.2–24.9  %).
Litter and bryophyte covers were significantly higher at the sub-alpine site. Plots had on average 2.8 ± 0.6 % bare soil cover (range: 0.2–13.8 %) and 1.75 ± 1.1 % rock cover (range: 0.2–8.0 %).

Vegetation height was on average 7.49 ± 0.44 cm (range: 0 - 23.5 cm) and bryophyte depth 2.31 ± 0.12 cm (range: 0 - 7 cm). The vegetation height was on average 5.75 cm taller and bryophyte depth was 1.78 cm deeper at the sub-alpine compared to the alpine site.

### Dataset (x): Soil structure

The soil structure dataset contains a total of 193 observations from 2019 and 2020.
Bulk density ranged between 0.4 to 1.3 g cm^-3^. It was highest at the sub-alpine site (0.8 ± 0.07 g cm^-3^), lowest at the alpine site (0.3 ± 0.04 g cm^-3^) and intermediate at the boreal site (0.5 ± 0.04 g cm^-3^; Figure 3).
The pH ranged between 4.1 and 5.52 and increased with elevation (average pH at the boreal: 4.2 ± 0.02, sub-alpine: 4.5 ± 0.09 and alpine: 5.2 ± 0.19; Figure 3).
The sand content varied between 84.2 and 97.2 %, the silt content between 2.22 and 14.7 % and the clay content between 0.42 and 1.12 %.
The mean sand, silt and clay content did however not differ between the three sites.
Pore water content ranged from 0.08 to 0.74 %.
It was similar at the boreal (0.26 ± 0.03 %) and sub-alpine sites (0.23 ± 0.08 %) and significantly higher at the alpine site (0.55 ± 0.04 %).

### Dataset (xi): Soil nutrients

This dataset contains a total of 1132 observations from 2019 to 2022.
Carbon and nitrogen content both increased with elevation (Figure 3).
The mean soil carbon content was 12.3 ± 0.64 % at the boreal site, 17.4 ± 0.88 % at the sub-alpine, and 29.7 ± 1.31 % at the alpine site.
The nitrogen content in the soil was on average 1.0 ± 0.04 % at the boreal site, 1.3 ± 0.06 % at the sub-alpine site, and 2.2 ± 0.09 % at the alpine site.
Soil organic matter increased with elevation (Figure 3) and was 0.21 ± 0.011 gm cm-3 at the boreal site, 0.32 ± 0.020 gm cm-3 at the sub-alpine site, and 0.57 ± 0.028 gm cm-3 at the alpine site.

The available nutrients Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, and Pb varied between sites and were higher at the alpine site compared to the boreal site (Figure 6).
There was no difference between the boreal and sub-alpine site for any of the nutrients.
All other available nutrients, B, Cu, NH4+, NO3-, P, and Zn did not differ between the sites.

### Dataset (xiii): Ecosystem CO2 fluxes

The 2020 CO2 fluxes dataset shows 440 measurements of ER, NEE and GPP (calculated from ER and NEE).
All four campaigns confounded, the warming treatment increased GPP by 96% at the sub-alpine site and 38% at the alpine site, and ER by 61% at the sub-alpine site and 19% at the alpine site (Figure 7).
The 2021 fluxes dataset shows 2051 measurements of ER, NEE and GPP. All four campaigns and fertilization and clipping confounded, the warming treatment decreased GPP by 18% at the sub-alpine site while increasing it by 58% at the alpine site, and ER decreased by 22% at the sub-alpine site while barely changing (+1.3%) at the alpine site.

Mean daily air temperature ranged between -1 to 22.6 °C, ground temperature between -1.06 to 24.5 °C, soil temperature between -0.56 to 20.0 °C and soil moisture between 0.022 to 0.522 percent, during the growing season May through September. 
The mean growing season air temperature at the boreal site was 12.36 ± 0.17 °C, the sub-alpine 9.12 ± 0.19 °C, and the alpine site 5.89 ± 0.20 °C (in situ measurement between May - September in 2019-2022), corresponding to approximately 3°C difference in summer air between the sites.
Soil temperature was on average 12.3 ± 0.13 °C at the boreal site, 8.88 ± 0.18 °C at the sub-alpine site, and 6.44 ± 0.20 °C at the alpine site.
Mean soil moisture during the growing season decreased with elevation from 37.6 % at the alpine site, 28.6 % at the subalpine site and 22.7 % at the lowest site.
The warmed plots had on average 3.31 °C higher air temperature, 3.19 °C higher soil temperature, and 7% lower soil moisture.
The nitrogen and grazing treatments did not affect microclimate.
