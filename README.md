assessment to aid mitigation of negative impacts by THREE global change
Drivers on alpine biodiversity and ecosystem function.

# INTRODUCTION

Three of the most critical **global change drivers** are warming,
nitrogen deposition, and grazing. All of these can have complex effects
on **biodiversity** and **ecosystem function**, and, especially for
biodiversity, effects can often be negative. For plant communities,
these impacts operate through many of the same ecological pathways,
involving changes in plant productivity and biomass as well as carbon
cycling processes. In this project we argue that by combining these
pathways into a single predictive framework we can both assess their
complex interactions and, importantly, generate approaches to mitigate
their combined effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function. In
particular, we take advantage of two key aspects of grazing: (i) its
impacts depend in a nonlinear and even non-monotonic way on plant
productivity, and (ii) it is being amenable to manipulation at a local
scale. This enables us to explore the circumstances under which grazing
is itself a major ecological stressor vs. acting as an effective tool
for reducing the ecological strains caused by climate warming and/or
nitrogen deposition. To assess effects of three global change drivers
and their impacts on ecosystem using a single framework, represents a
significant advancement beyond the state-of-the-art.

The specific research questions of the THREE-D project are:

1)  How does grazing interact with climate warming and/or nitrogen
    deposition and affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in an
    alpine ecosystem?

2)  When and at what level does grazing mitigate the effects of these
    two global change drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning?

## METHODS

### Research site

The study is conducted in three semi-natural grassland sites in western
Norway and the eastern edge of the Himalaya in Gongga Mountain, Sichuan
in China. The sites are location on calcareous soil in Norway, and on
mountain grey-brown soil in China. The sites were chosen to fit within
an elevational gradient with three temperature levels that differ in
c. 400 m elevation, a temperature difference of approximately 2°C in
summer temperature (Figure 1). The sites correspond to the alpine,
sub-alpine and boreal biogeographic zones in Norway and subalpine to
alpine grasslands in China. Other factors such as grazing regime and
history, bedrock, vegetation type and structure, slope and exposure were
kept as constant as possible among the selected sites within each
country.

We chose species rich grasslands, that were large enough to contain 80
50 x 50 cm plots and relatively flat to avoid contamination between the
different nitrogen treatments and for convenience when measuring carbon
fluxes. A second criteria, was to have a high enough elevational
gradient, to get an equal distance of 400 – 500 m difference in
elevation between each of the sites. The sites should also be relatively
easy to access, because of transplanting large turfs. Finally, we wanted
other environmental factors to be as similar as possible among the
sites, within each of the countries (i.e. grazing regime and history,
bedrock, vegetation type and structure, slope and exposure).

layer.](README_files/figure-gfm/site-figure-1.png)

### Experimental design

In each site, a large enough area for 40 – 80 plots was chosen. Ten
blocks, with 6 plots inside was marked with wooden poles in each corner.
Four aluminium pipes were hammered down into the soil in the outer
corners of each 50 x 50 cm plot @ref(fig:exp\_design). In addition, in
the centre of the plot, we marked a 25 x 25 cm inner plots using the
same method, ensuring the pipes to fit the corners of the standardized
vegetation analysis frame (aluminium frame demarking a 25 x 25 cm inner
area, with poles fixed in the corners that fit into the aluminium tubes
used for plot demarcation in the field). The upslope left corner tubes
were marked with a colour-coded waterproof tape. Applying permanent
plots for the treatments enable to find the exact same quadrate in the
years to come. The area where the fence was set up, was marked. Then 2
plot per block for the natural grazing treatment were chosen outside the
fence. These plots were \< 10m from the adjacent block to have the same
vegetation, but not too close to be affected by the fence. Each plot was
divided into non-destructive (25 x 25 cm; inner area) and destructive
(area between the 25 x 25 cm and 50 x 50 cm plot) sampling areas. Plant
community composition, carbon fluxes (GPP, Reco), and biomass harvest
was conducted in a non-destructive subplot. The rest of the plot was
used for destructive soil sampling (soil samples), nutrients (PRS
probes), root ingrowth cores and litter decomposition and provided an
opportunity for add-on projects during the THREE-D project (e.g. trait
measurements). Each plot was given a unique originPlotID starting at the
upper left corner in block 1 and the high site. The numbering was
continued to 160. After transplanting, each turf also received a unique
destinationPlotID (a number from 1-200; see below). A realized site map
with the actual location of each plot and block in all the sites was
drawn and pictures of each site, block and plot was taken. The fence was
set up in autumn 2019 in China and in spring 2020 in Norway before the
grazing animals arrived at the sites.

The randomization of the treatments was done in two steps. First, the 10
nitrogen levels were assigned randomly per block (i.e. block 1 received
the same nitrogen level in each site). We chose to randomize the
nitrogen treatment at the block level to avoid contamination between the
plots within the blocks. If a block had a nitrogen treatment that was \>
2 levels higher than the block downslope from the block, the nitrogen
treatments were switched. This procedure was repeated until no nitrogen
contamination was possible from upslope blocks. Second, the warming and
grazing treatments were randomized within block. The six plots within
each block (inside the fence) were randomly assigned a warming and
grazing treatment. The two plots per block located outside the fence,
were randomly assigned a warming treatment. Each block contained eight
plots with one nitrogen level, ambient and warmed plots, combined with
all four grazing levels. The total number of plots was 160.

### Experimental treatments

All the treatments were applied to the whole 50 x 50 cm plot (Figure
2B).

**Warming treatment** The warming treatment was conducted at the end of
the growing season in 2019, by transplanting entire plant communities to
the lower elevation (c. +2-3°C). The upslope left-hand corner of each
turf was marked with a toothpick that the turfs could be placed in the
similar position relative to the slope and block orientation at the
destination site. We used a knife to cut the turfs to 50 x 50 cm and to
a depth of c. 10 - 25 cm, unless the soil was shallower, as was the case
for some of the alpine plots. After excavation, the turfs were packed
into a cardboard box and transported to their respective target sites
within one day. The control plots were not excavated or moved. We did
not have local transplants, to control for the transplanting effect,
because this was tested in a previous project and the transplanting did
not affect species composition in any of the system: SeedClim (Vandvik
et al. 2020) and TransPlant, (Yang et al., 2018).

The turfs were fitted into the gaps created by excavating turfs at the
destination site, except for the low site, where gaps had to be made.
Each block received one plot of each treatment. Turfs were placed in the
block with the same numerical value (1 - 10) in the destination site as
they originated from in the origin site. Transplanted turfs were
carefully planted into their destination plots (destinationPlotID)
ensuring that the turf orientation was correct (using the toothpick
marking the uphill left corner of each turf) that the soil surface was
in plane with the surrounding vegetation, and that the edges of the
excavated plot was in good contact with the edges of the gap created
when the original turf was excavated from the plot. If necessary, loose
soil was carefully removed from the underside of the turf, or local soil
was added to the gap or around the edges to achieve this.

**Nitrogen addition** In each plot we added slow dissolving fertilizer
as pellets (YaraBela OPTI-NS 27-0-0 (4S)). We used oxidised nitrogen (NO
and N<sub>2</sub>O) formed mainly by combustion processes, which are the
main sources of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in remote regions (i.e.,
away from intensive agriculture and other sources or reduced nitrogen).
The fertilizer was added once at the start and once in the middle of the
growing season from 2020 - 2021 (or 2022). Each block reveived one of
the seven nitrogen levels: 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 150 kg N
ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>. Three of the blocks received 0 kg N
ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> to act as a proper control.

The natural nitrogen deposition differs in Norway (1.5-3.5 kg N
ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) and China (2-4 kg N ha<sup>−1</sup>
yr<sup>−1</sup>). The critical load for changing species composition in
these alpine grasslands is approximately 5-10 and 15 kg N
ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> in Norway and China, respectively. We
therefore wanted to have a range of nitrogen levels that were below and
well above this critical load. Although the natural annual deposition
differs between Norway and China, the Nitrogen addition was kept the
same in both countries.

In 2020, the nitrogen treatment was only applied once at Vikesland due
to an accident.

**Grazing treatment** The warming and nitrogen treatments were crossed
with four grazing treatments. Grazing was simulated by clipping the
vegetation manually with scissors 2-3 cm above the ground. The four
grazing treatments were natural grazing (N; outside the fence), medium
level of grazing (M; 2x clipp), intensive level of grazing (I; 4x
clipp), and untreated control plots (C). The intermediate clipping level
reflects the natural grazing level outside the exclosure and should
control for differences between grazing and clipping (i.e. clipping is
not selective and will not add faeces and urine). The medium and
intensive plots were clipped 2 or 4 times during the growing season. The
clipping treatment was conducted in 2020 - 2021 (2022).

The realized cutting in 2020 is shown in the table below. In 2020, the
intensive grazing level at the higest site in Norway (Liahovden) only
received 3 cuts, because the growing season was short due to snow and a
cold spring. The vegetation did not grow very much at the end of the
season and an additional cut would not have removed anymore biomass. The
intensive grazed plots received 4 cuts (1-4), except Lia (1,2,4), and
the intermediate grazed plots received 2 cuts (1,4). Cut 3 for Lia does
not exist in 2020.

**Field site maintenance** To simulate the natural grazing regime at
each site, and to avoid accumulation of biomass, all biomass within the
fence was removed at the end of each field season. Note that the biomass
removal, is not the same as the grazing treatment (see above) and
biomass harvesting (see below). The grazing treatment is applied to each
plot (50 x 50 cm) in early and peak season, while the biomass harvesting
occurs at the end of the last field season (25 x 25cm plot). The site
maintenance has to be done after biomass harvesting.

Climate data was downloaded at start and the end of each field season.

#### Data handling and curation

All collected data was checked for errors and unrealistic values using
vizualization. Errors were fixed or deleted if there was a valid reason.

The community data was checked using turf maps that show change in
species cover over time (see below).

**Site/plot level meta data** Elevation was assessed using a GPS at the
site level, while slope, exposure and soil depth (using metal pole at
each corner) was recorded for each plot.

**Plant species composition** Plant species composition was recorded
annually at peak growing season, in 2019 and 2021. In 2020, not all the
plots were surveyed due to fieldwork restrictions related to the corona
pandemic. Each 25 x 25 cm plots was divided into 25 subplots (Figure 3).
The recording started in the upper left corner, and went row by row,
from left to the right. In each subplot and for each species we recorded
presence as sterile (1), dominant (D; covered more than 50% of the
sub-plot), fertile (F; bud, flower, seeds), juvenile (J; not yet adult),
or a seedling (S; cotyledons still attached; S). For each species, the
highest level was recorded, i.e. if there was a seedling and an adult,
the adult was recorded. So, the number of juveniles and seedlings were
only consistently recorded if these were the only individuals present in
the subplot of that species. We also noted the presence of seedlings in
each subplot, but they were not identified to species. In addition, we
recorded the percentage cover of vascular plants (only total),
bryophytes, lichen, litter, bare ground and bare rock in each subplot.

In 2020, species composition was recorded fully only for the control and
warmed plots receiving no nitrogen (block 1, 4, and 10). For the rest of
the plots, only percentage cover by functional group was recorded.

<p class="caption">

for the vegetation height measurements.

</div>

In each 25 x 25 cm plot, the total percentage cover of each vascular
plant species was estimated visually. At 4 points in the grid (orange
subplots in Figure 3), average vegetation height and moss layer depth
was measured using a ruler. For each turf, date, originSite,
originBlockID, originPlotID, weather, scribe and recorder and remarks
were noted down. A picture was taken from each plot.

For the Norwegian data, the nomenclature follows Lid & Lid(2010). Each
species of vascular plant was classified by functional type (graminoid,
forb, woody) and biogeographic affinity based on information given in
Lid & Lid(2010). Specifically, species reported to be present in the
Nemoral but lacking from the Low- Mid- or High Alpine are classified as
“lowland”, species present in the Alpine but lacking from the Nemoral
to South Boreal are classified as “alpine”, whereas all other species
(i.e., species that span the gradient from Nemoral to Alpine zones) are
classified as “generalist”. Write something about China…

*Data handling:* After each field season the data was checked vizually
by plotting the cover of each species per plot over time. This allowed
to compare change in species composition over time and check for errors.
Obvious errors in species identification was corrected after comparing
these plots. Problematic species are: - Taraxacum and Leontodon - all
Carex species - Antennaria alpina and dioica - Festuca ovina and rubra
and maybe Avenella flexuosa

**Reflectance** Reflectance (greeness) was measured several times during
the season in each plot from 2020-2021 (2022). The greenseeker measures
in an elliptical shape, and the light source and receiver should be
located in the middle of the plot. The green seeker is placed 60 cm
above the plot and parallel to the ground, using a ruler. Two
measurements are done per plot perpendicular to each other to account
for the elliptical shape.

*Data handling:* The data was visually checked for unrealistic values,
which were corrected or removed if there was a valid reason (e.g. shade
or snow on the plot). Unrealistic values, where the comma was forgotten,
were divided by 100.

**Aboveground biomass** There are two types of biomass measurements.

*Grazing treatment:* biomass was clipped and harvested as a grazing
treatment in the plots that received intermediate or intensive grazing.
The biomass was clipped 2cm above the ground in several round during
each growing season (2020-2021, 2022?). The biomass was stored in the
freezer until sorted into functional groups: grasses, sedges, forbs,
legumes, shrubs, bryophytes, lichens and litter. The biomass was then
dried at 65°C for 72 hours and weighed.

*Biomass harvest:* Biomass will was harvested at the end of the growing
season in 2021 from all plots. The vegetation was cut 2cm above the
ground and stored in the freezer until sorted into functional groups:
grasses, sedges, forbs, legumes, shrubs, bryophytes, lichens and litter.
The biomass was then dried at 65°C for 72 hours and weighed.

*Data handling:* The data was visually checked for unrealistic values,
which were corrected or removed if there was a valid reason.

**Ecosystem fluxes** Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem
respiration (ER) were measured on the field while gross ecosystem
production (GEP) is calculated as GEP = NEE - ER. Carbon fluxes are
measured with a closed loop chamber system connected to an infrared gaz
analyser (INGRA; Li-840A, Li-cor). The plexiglas chamber (25x25x40 cm)
is connected to the INGRA with plastic tubes (inlet and outlet, 3m long
and 4mm diameter each). A filter prevents water droplets and small
particules from entering the INGRA and an air pump ensures a flow of
1L/mn. The chamber is equiped with a fan to mix the air, a thermocouple
(Pt1000, Delta-T) to measure air temperature and a PAR sensor. In 2020
the air temperature was measured with an iButton. Airtightness is
ensured by laying a heavy chain on the “skirt” of the chamber (a piece
of tarp taped to the lower part of the chamber). NEE is measured with a
transparent chamber. ER is measured with a dark chamber, in our case the
transparent chamber was covered with a thick dark tarp. The
CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was measured every seconds and logged in a
datalogger (Squirrel 2010). The chamber was put on the plot during two
minutes for each measurements and then aired during one minute. Since
the logger was logging continuesly, the start and end time of each
measurement was noted (it is necessary to precisely synchronise the
logger clock with the watch used on the field and to regularly check
it). The function `match.flux()` is matching the time in the logger file
with the plot being measured at that time (using the time recorded on
the field). It attributes the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> measured
every seconds to the correct measurement. A linear regression is fitted
to every measurements and the slope is used to calculated the flux.

**Soil sampling for CN stocks, pH, soil organic matter and soil
texture** In summer 2019, two soil samples were collected from each
blocks, but outside the plots. The soil samples of 5 cm diameter and 4 -
8 cm deep were taken. One sample was taken from the upper organic layer,
and another one from the lower part of the soil. In 2020, 5 soil samples
per site were taken using the same method for CN stocks. The soil
samples were stored in the fridge (4°C) until further use.

The soils samples were dried at 60°C for 24h and sieved with a 2mm
sieve. Each soil sample was weighed before and after drying to measure
the water stored in each sample. Stones and larger roots were sorted and
weighed.

**Soil pH** The pH was measured in a soil water solution. The soil:water
ratio depends on the amount of organic matter in the soil with a ratio
of soil to water of 1:2.5 to 1:5 by weight for mineral soil. The method
described here is based upon that employed by the Soil Survey of England
and Wales (Avery & Bascomb, 1974) and by the Countryside Survey (Emmett
et al., 2010).

The pH meter was calibrated in a buffer solutions of pH 4, 7 and 9 and
was regularly checked again after some samples.

10 g of fresh field-moist soil was weighed into a 50 ml plastic pH
beaker. 50 ml of deionised water was added and the suspension was
stirred thoroughly. After 30 minutes of waiting and occasionally
stirring, the soil pH was measured electrometrically using the
calibrated pH meter.

**Soil organic matter** (Hidden Cost protocol) To measure soil organic
matter (SOM), we used the method described by Ball(1964). 10 g of fresh
soil was weight into a cup. The soil was then dried for 16h at 105°C.
The soil was weighed again. Then the sample was placed in a furnace for
6h at 550 °C. The soil was weighed again. The sample was burned a second
time at 950°C for 1h and weight recorded after cooling period in the
desiccator

SOM is defined as the difference in the weight between the dried and
burned soil.

The weight loss when the samples are dried at 105 °C (wet weight - dry
weight) represents of the amount of pore-water held within the sample.
The percentage of water should be expressed as a proportion of the wet
weight. The weight loss between 105 and 550°C as a percentage of the
total original dry sample weight is the % organic material. The weight
loss between 550 and 950°C is representative of the amount of
CO<sub>2</sub> released from the sample.

**Bulk density**

**Soil Texture**

**Climate data** Temperature was measured continuously (every 15 min) at
three heights (15 cm, at ground level, and 5 cm below ground) and soil
moisture was measured continuously 5 cm below ground using Tomst TM4
loggers (Wild et al., 2019). A Tomst logger was placed in all 6 plots
inside the fence in the blocks receiving nitrogen treatments: N1, N2,
N4, N5, N6, N9, N10 (the plots receiving a climate logger will be
indicated on the site map). The logger was place in the corner of the
50x50 cm plot. The climate loggers were put on the plots between July
and September 2019. In total there are 72 climate loggers. The
Three-D\_ClimateLogger\_meta\_2019.xlsx file has information when which
logger was put out.

**Gridded climate data** Gridded data are daily climate values for three
sites from 2009 - 2019 from The Norwegian Meteorological Institute (from
Ole Einar Tveito, 16.12.2019). The climate variables are: - Mean daily
temperature (°C, Temperature)  
\- Relative air moisture (%, RelAirMoisture)  
\- Mean wind (meter / second, Wind)  
\- Mean cloud cover (in 8 parts, no dimension, CloudCover)  
\- Precipitation (mm, Precipitation)
